title: Course Information for Summer 2017
---

## Prerequisites: None
Absolutely no background in computer programming or statistics is needed.  We will occasionally use math at the level 
of high school algebra and trigonometry, but that kind of math isn't critical to the course.

## Texts

The required text is [Computational Thinking with Data](/textbook), which is available for free online.  If you want a printed copy, a PDF is available, and there are [many stores around campus](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Printing&find_loc=Berkeley,+CA) at which you can print it.

### Useful references
- Solutions will be released for all homework and lab assignments after they are due.  Simply click the link to the assignment again on the course schedule.  For lab 1, for example, the solutions notebook will be named `lab01_solution.ipynb`.
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com): A great resource for general questions about programming and Python.  If you have a question, probably someone else has asked it here and gotten an answer from an expert.
- Data 8 lectures from [Spring 2017](https://data8.org/sp17) or [Fall 2016](https://data8.org/fa16): There is some overlap in topics between Data 8 and Data 8R, and you may find lectures or other materials from Data 8 useful.
- Relatedly, the Data 8 textbook [Computational and Inferential Thinking](http://inferentialthinking.org), by Ani Adhikari and John Denero, overlaps some of the content of this course, and you may find the alternate viewpoint complementary.
- [Documentation for the `datascience` package](https://data8.org/datascience/): We'll be using a package of Python code called `datascience` that was designed at Berkeley for introductory data science courses like this one.  The documentation will be a useful reference.  (It's possible to access documentation in a Jupyter notebook, without opening a new browser tab.  In a code cell, write the function you're curious about, followed by `?`, and then run the cell.)

## Infrastructure
- [data8r.datahub.berkeley.edu](https://data8r.datahub.berkeley.edu) is where you'll run code and work on most assignments in this class.  You don't need to install anything to use it, other than a (supported) browser like [Chrome](https://google.com/chrome).  You don't usually need to visit the site directly: to work on an assignment, click its link on the course homepage.  (You may need to sign in to your @berkeley.edu Google account and then click Start Server.)  Click on the file with a name ending in `.ipynb` to open the assignment notebook.
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com) is the primary web-based way for us to communicate with each other.  It's basically a forum with a single discussion board.  If we make an announcement, it will be on Piazza, so be sure to sign up!  If you have a question when you're not in class or at office hours, asking it on Piazza is the fastest way to get an answer.  In the past, many students have enjoyed answering other students' questions.
- The [okpy](https://okpy.org) autograder and submission system will manage your homework and lab assignment submissions.  You'll submit your work to okpy by running a cell in each assignment's Jupyter notebook.  You can visit the [okpy website](okpy.org) to check your submissions and grades.
- When exams happen, exam grades (and a graded copy of your exam) will be available at [Gradescope](gradescope.com).

## The Required Components of Your Work
One goal of this course is that you master the fundamentals of the programming language Python.  Like any language, Python is best learned by repeated, continuous practice.  That's the main purpose of the labs, quizzes, and weekly homework assignments.

1. Weekly homework, which you will do in Jupyter notebooks.  Each homework will have its own due date, but homeworks will generally be assigned on Thursday and due the following Tuesday at 1 PM (before lecture).  Homework 1 is due a day later than other homeworks, since the following Tuesday is a holiday.
2. 1-hour labs on Mondays and Wednesdays and 2-hour labs on Fridays.  Each lab is a Jupyter notebook and is submitted to [okpy](okpy.org) in the same fashion as homework.  Each lab is designed so that you can complete it (or almost complete it) during the day's lab session.  Each lab is due at 11:59 PM on the day it's assigned.  If you attend lab, your grade for the lab assignment will be based on a reasonable standard of completion for the lab period, often less than full completion.  If you don't attend lab, we expect you to complete the entire lab assignment to receive full credit.
3. Several quizzes, or "vitamins," per week.  Most vitamins are very short Google Forms designed to remind you about what you learned in lecture.  If you're spending more than 10 minutes on a vitamin, please ask for help.  Each vitamin is due at 11:59 PM on the day it's assigned.
4. Midterm in class on 7/14, during the normal Friday lab period 1-3 PM. Location TBD. No substitutes except as required by university rules. No computers involved.
5. Final exam in class on 8/4, during the normal Friday lab period 1-3 PM. Location TBD. No computers involved. The final is required for getting a passing grade.

Data science is not a solitary activity; please expect to attend lectures, discussion section, and lab. Lectures will not be webcast, but the online text will contain what is covered apart from discussions generated by questions asked in class.

### Grading
We would prefer not to assign grades at all; it is our job as instructors to teach material that is exciting to you and useful for the rest of your life. Humans are natural learners, and grades sometimes diminish that capacity. Still, grades help to motivate learning for some people, and the university requires that we assign them.

Your overall grade percentage will be a weighted average of your work on each type of assignment:
* Homework: 20%
* Short (Monday/Wednesday) labs: 10%
* Long (Friday) labs: 10%
* Vitamins (quizzes): 20%
* Midterm: 15%
* Final: 25%

We will drop some of your lowest assignment grades.  This comes with a caveat: we will only drop assignments on which you've shown a *reasonable effort*.  For example, if you don't turn in an assignment, we won't drop it, and instead we'll drop your next lowest grade.  One homework, two short labs, and four vitamins will be dropped in this way.

As in many Berkeley courses, letter grades will not have predefined cutoffs, like 90% for an A-.  The instructors will decide the cutoffs at the end of the term based on our judgement of the difficulty of the material and the efforts made by students.  You are not competing with other students; we are happy to assign mostly As and Bs if most students make a strong effort and master the material.

#### Finding your grades
[bCourses](bcourses.berkeley.edu) is where final grades will be posted, but unfortunately it's not very good.  Instead you can find your grades in 3 places:
* Homework and lab grades are available on [okpy](okpy.org).
* Vitamin grades are available on the forms themselves after you submit them.
* Exam grades are available on [Gradescope](gradescope.com).

### Collaboration
Working with other people is usually, but not always, a very good way to learn.  We therefore encourage collaboration in most areas of the course, with a few exceptions.  You are completely free to collaborate on labs, homeworks, and vitamins, except that:
* you may not share answers directly,
* you must always type your own answers, and
* you must give *written credit* to any source or person you consult, other than course staff or materials.  (In Python code, you can use `#` comments to write down your sources.)

Of course, you may not give or receive help (except from course staff) during exams.

There is an element of judgement in interpreting these rules, and we expect you to exercise good judgement.  You can always ask course staff if you aren't sure whether something is okay.  Violation of the collaboration policy is considered academic dishonesty and carries stiff penalties at Berkeley.  You can find the code of student conduct [here](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/integrity).
