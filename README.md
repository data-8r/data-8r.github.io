# Data 8R Website
This is the README for the GitHub project page for the Data 8R website.  The page itself is published at [data8r.org](https://data8r.org).

The project layout for this page was copied from the layout of the Prob 140 website [here](https://github.com/prob140/prob140.github.io) as of 05/2017.  Few details have been changed, other than the course materials themselves.  The GitHub repo for that site has some READMEs that might be useful in understanding the layout and build of this website.
